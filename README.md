# Task 2 Number Guessing Game
Task-2 of Java Programming Internship at Oasis Infobyte

This is a simple interactive random number guessing project, designed using Java Swing and AWT. In this project, the computer generates a random number between 1-100. We have to keep guessing the number until we find the computerâ€™s number. Each time we guess the wrong number, the computer will tell us whether the number is lower or higher than the one we guessed. The game limits the number of attempts to 10.
